SWAGE
=====
The **SWAGE** sub-library contains a large suite of mesh data structures, a rich set of index spaces for different geometric entities, and many connectivity arrays between the various index spaces.  
This library supports both unstructured linear and arbitrary-order meshes.  
**SWAGE** is designed to support a diverse range of methods that arise in computational physics and engineering.
