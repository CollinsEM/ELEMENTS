MATAR
=====
The **MATAR** sub-library is designed for dense and sparse data representations, and follows the data-oriented programming approach for highly efficient calculations.  
**MATAR** leverages **Kokkos** for performance portability over diverse architectures. 
The data representations developed in **MATAR** and the numerical tools in **ELEMENTS** are designed for performance, portability, and productivity (i.e., ease of use).  
**MATAR** is stored in a separate repository as it can aid many applications, as such, it is included as a GitHub submodule in the **ELEMENTS** repository.
Please see the `MATAR documentation <https://lanl.github.io/MATAR/>`_ for more details.
