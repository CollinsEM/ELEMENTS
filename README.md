## What is ELEMENTS?

The C++ **ELEMENTS** library is a collection of sub-libraries to support implementing a diverse range of numerical methods on low and high-order meshes.  The **ELEMENTS** library can be used for research and development of both continuous and discontinuous finite element methods, as well as, finite volume methods to solve a diverse range of partial differential equations. The **ELEMENTS** library includes the following sub-libraries:  **MATAR** contains the routines to support dense and sparse **mat**rices and **ar**rays, **SLAM** contains the interfaces to **s**olvers, **l**inear **a**lgebra, and **m**athematical routines or external packages (e.g., Trilinos),  **elements** contains the mathematical functions to support a large range of elements types including serendipity elements, **SWAGE** contains the routines and data-structures to support unstructured arbitrary-order 3D meshes that move or remain stationary, and **geometry** combines together **SWAGE** and **elements**.  The **ELEMENTS** libary is designed to support Lagrangian (mesh moves) solid dynamics and mechanics codes, Eulerian (mesh is stationary) fluid dynamics codes, and many other code applications.
