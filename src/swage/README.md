# SWAGE
The **sw**ift L**ag**rangian to **E**ulerian (**SWAGE**) mesh library is very general and allows users to implement a large range of numerical methods on unstructured arbitrary-order 3D meshes.  This library supports connectivity data structures and index spaces needed to implement either low-order or high-order numerical methods.  **SWAGE** is designed to work with the **elements** library that contains e.g., quadrature sets, basis functions, Jacobian matrices, etc.  The **SWAGE** mesh library has unique index spaces to support arbitrary-order Lagrangian material dynamics codes that solve the governing equations for motion on an arbitrary-order mesh that moves with the material.  The **SWAGE** mesh library also allows code developers to create high-order Eulerian fluid dynamics codes using high-order meshes that are conformal to a curved boundary (e.g., a wing).  **SWAGE** relies on the **MATAR** library to access multidimensional data and couples with the elements library inside the geometry library.

## Descriptions
The index spaces in **SWAGE** are:

* elements (the computational mesh is decomposed into non-overlapping elements)
* vertices (kinematic degrees of freedom for an element)
* nodes (a continuous space that coincides with the Lobatto point locations)
* gauss points (a discontinuous space that are the Lobatto point locations)
* sub-cells (a decomposition of an element using the nodes), abbreviated as cells
* sub-zones (a decomposition of an element using the vertices), abbreviated as zones
* surface (a surface of the element)
* patch (a portion of the element surface that coincides with the surface of a sub-cell)
* facet (a portion of a patch)
* corner (a corner of a sub-cell)

Connectivity data structures exist to map from from an index to another index space (e.g., all nodes in an element) and to walk over neighboring mesh entities (e.g., all sub-cells around a sub-cell).  The **SWAGE** library is stitched together with the elements library in the geometry library to support arbitrary-order meshes (i.e., elements with linear or curved edges) and diverse numerical schemes including continuous and discontinuous finite element methods, and finite volume methods.

### Index naming conventions
The global index spaces for the mesh (but local to a rank) are denoted with a _gid_.  The index spaces for the local mesh entities, relative to a _gid_, are denoted with a _lid_.  The index spaces in a reference element, which comes from the elements library and are not in **SWAGE**, are denoted with a _rid_.  A local refernce index, relative to a _rid_, is denoted with a _rlid_.

### Connectivity functions naming conventions
The general form of all connectivity structures, in terms an arbitrary mesh entity, is,
```
// entity is generic for illustrative purposes and can be cell, element, node, etc., 
// likewise, something is generic for illustrative purposes and is some mesh entity 
for (int something_lid = 0; something_lid < mesh.num_something_in_entity(entity_gid); something_lid++){
   int something_gid = mesh.something_in_entity(entity_gid, something_lid); 
   // ...
}
```

## Usage
To code to walk over all the elements in the mesh and then over all the sub-cells in the element would be, 
```
for(int elem_gid = 0; elem_gid < mesh.num_elems(); elem_gid++){
   for(int cell_lid = 0; cell_lid < mesh.num_cells_in_elem(); cell_lid++){ 
      int cell_gid = mesh.cells_in_elem(elem_gid, cell_lid);  // access the cell mesh index 
      // ...
   }
}
```

Then, to walk over all the corners in a sub-cell or all the nodes in a sub-cell would be, 

```
for(int elem_gid = 0; elem_gid < mesh.num_elems(); elem_gid++){
   for(int cell_lid = 0; cell_lid < mesh.num_cells_in_elem(); cell_lid++){
      int cell_gid = mesh.cells_in_elem(elem_gid, cell_lid);
      
      for(int node_lid = 0; node_lid < 8; node_lid++){
         int node_gid = mesh.nodes_in_cell(cell_gid, node_lid);  // access the node mesh index
         int corner_gid = mesh.corners_in_cell(cell_gid, node_lid);  // access the corner mesh index
         // ...
      }
      
   }   
}
```

Then, the code to walk over all the surface facets in a corner would be,

```
for(int elem_gid = 0; elem_gid < mesh.num_elems(); elem_gid++){
   for(int cell_lid = 0; cell_lid < mesh.num_cells_in_elem(); cell_lid++){
      int cell_gid = mesh.cells_in_elem(elem_gid, cell_lid);
      
      for(int node_lid = 0; node_lid < 8; node_lid++){
         int node_gid = mesh.nodes_in_cell(cell_gid, node_lid);  // access the node mesh index
         int corner_gid = mesh.corners_in_cell(cell_gid, node_lid);  // access the corner mesh index
         
         for(int facet_lid = 0; facet_lid < 3; facet_lid++){
            // ...
         }
         
      }
      
   }   
}
```

There are many ways to walk over or access an index space. To just walk over all the nodes in the mesh, the code is,

```
for (int node_gid = 0; node_gid < mesh.num_nodes(); node_gid++) {
   // ...
} // end for loop over nodes
```

Then, to walk over all the corners in a node would be,

```
for (int node_gid = 0; node_gid < mesh.num_nodes(); node_gid++) {
   for(int corn_lid = 0; corn_lid < mesh.num_corners_in_node(node_gid); corn_lid++){
      int corner_gid = mesh.corners_in_node(node_gid, corn_lid);  // access the corner mesh index
      // ...
   }   
} // end for loop over nodes
```

**SWAGE** supports unstructured meshes so the number of corners around a node can vary across the mesh.  **SWAGE** offers many ways to access index neighbors.  One example is accessing all nieghboring cells to a cell,

```
for(int cell_gid = 0; cell_gid < mesh.num_cells(); cell_gid++){
   for (int neighbor_lid = 0; neighbor_lid < mesh.num_cells_in_cell(cell_gid); neighbor_lid++){
      int neighbor_cell_gid = mesh.cells_in_cell(cell_gid, neighbor_lid);  // Get mesh index for the neighboring cell
      // ...
   }
}   
```

The data structures in **SWAGE** like mesh.cells_in_cell(cell_gid, neighbor_lid) and mesh.corners_in_node(node_gid, corn_lid) access the data in a contiguous manner to deliver optiminal runtime performance.
